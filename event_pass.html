Hey! If you are reading this, good for you! It's important to look under the hood. 
If you are good at hacking things, please be nice. This is a work in progress where I am working with students to create this site.
If you'd like to help out, reach out to me at kents@fultonschools.org. 

If you are poking around and find an error or - worst case scenario - an exploit, please, please, let me know. This is a complicated project, and 
as a full time principal coding on the side, it's hard to do all the testing we should. 

If you'd like to see the code base, i'll soon have a repository on GitHub for you to check out.
